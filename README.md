First name of this project was Small Files Remover because I used it for purpose to scan huge file list based on parameter of file size and to remove all off files smaller than limit. Later on I realized that this app could be upgradet to do much more... so much more.

Purpose: scan through file system for files based on some parameter and execude command to rename, move, remove, edit or simple list selected files. What this app solves? It automatize process of search and execute on huge number of files.

How to compile:
	g++ main.cpp -o fscalper
